- Retail momentum is cooling off slightly after the initial bull run, but retail traders are still participating actively—especially in meme coins and new launches.
- Sentiment remains bullish after stimulus news and strong price momentum, with a continued focus on short-term rallies, but concentration is gradually shifting toward headline altcoins and less toward isolated micro-cap tokens.[10][11]

### Institutional
- Despite some outflows, ETF flows and institutional allocations continue to be robust. Major institutions are increasing their long-term stakes in digital assets, with growing interest in tokenization and blockchain infrastructure.
- Institutional players appear to be taking a longer-term view, using current market volatility to increase allocations and position for future use cases and infrastructure growth.[12][13]
