# What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables machines, such as computers, to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning from data, recognizing speech, visual perception, decision-making, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and even generating new content. AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict future events, and make autonomous decisions with little or no human intervention. AI has evolved from the concept coined in 1956 and now encompasses a broad range of technologies and disciplines including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. It is widely used today in applications like virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, recommendation engines, and more, aiming to augment human capabilities and enhance productivity.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4][^1_7]
